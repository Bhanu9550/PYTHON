## 🤔 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

### `if` Statement

**Definition**: Executes a block of code only when its condition is true.

**Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    #code to execute if condition is true
```

### `if-else` Statement

**Definition**: Executes the `if` block if the condition is true, otherwise executes the `else` block.

**Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # code to execute if condition is false
```

### `if-elif-else` Statement

**Definition**: Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the first block where the condition is true. If no conditions are true, the `else` block is executed.

**Syntax**:
```python
if condition_1:
    # executes if condition_1 is true
elif condition_2:
    # executes if condition_1 is false and condition_2 is true
else:
    # executes if all preceding conditions are false
```



### Nested `if` Statements

**Definition**: An `if` statement placed inside another `if` statement. This is used for checking secondary conditions.

**Syntax**:
```python
if condition_1:
    # executes if condition_1 is true
    if condition_2:
        # executes only if both condition_1 and condition_2 are true
```

## 🔁 Loop Statements

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

### `for` Loop

**Definition**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects.

**Syntax**:
```python
for item in iterable:
    # code block to execute for each item
```


### Nested `for` Loop

**Definition**: A `for` loop placed inside another `for` loop. The inner loop will be executed for each iteration of the outer loop.

**Syntax**:
```python
for item_1 in iterable_1:
    for item_2 in iterable_2:
        # nested code block
```

### `while` Loop

**Definition**: Repeatedly executes a code block as long as a given condition remains true.

**Syntax**:
```python
while condition:
    # code block to execute
    # remember to include logic to eventually make the condition false!
```
